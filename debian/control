Description: bootstrapping tool for creating supermin appliances
 febootstrap is a tool for building supermin appliances. These are
 tiny appliances [similar to virtual machines], usually around 100KB
 in size, which get fully instantiated on-the-fly in a fraction of a
 second when you need to boot one of them.
