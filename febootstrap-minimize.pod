=head1 NAME

febootstrap-minimize - Minimize an febootstrap image

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 febootstrap-minimize [--options] DIR

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<febootstrap-minimize> minimizes an L<febootstrap(8)>-created
filesystem.  This means that unneeded files and cruft are removed from
the image.

If no options are given, the default is to minimize the image as much
as possible.  This means, for example, that locales are removed so the
image will only be usable in US-English, there will be no
documentation or manual pages, and the image will only work in a UTC
timezone.

Note that image minimization involves deleting files that have been
installed by RPM.  Thus after minimization, it is no longer guaranteed
that RPM will function correctly on the image.  You should only do
this as a final step for "throwaway" appliances that do not need to be
modified or upgraded in future.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--all>

Perform all minimization operations, to produce the smallest possible
image.  Note in particular that locales are discarded.

You can perform all minimization operations I<except> X, Y and Z by
doing:

 febootstrap-minimize --all --keep-X --keep-Y --keep-Z ...

(C<--all> can be omitted since it is the default).

=item B<--none>

Start with no minimization operations.  You can specify I<only>
minimization operations X, Y and Z like this:

 febootstrap-minimize --none --drop-X --drop-Y --drop-Z ...
